# About QCity

QCity is a plugin to QGIS for modelling existing and potential urban development. QCity models developments on a building level basis and aggregates the data from the building levels across a project area. This enables the calculation of:

1. Dwelling yield
2. Commercial floorspace yield
3. Car and bicycle parking yield

QCity data can be visualised in 3D together with other spatial data for visualisation purposes and assessing the bulk and scale of modelled developments in relation to surrounding areas.

QCity was originally developed by [North Road Consulting](https://north-road.com/) with funding from the [City of Canning](https://canning.wa.gov.au), Perth, Western Australia.
